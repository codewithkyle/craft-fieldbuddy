# Field Buddy plugin for Craft CMS 3

Field Buddy adds a small icon next field labels (dev mode only). When clicked the field's handle will be copied to your clipboard. Field Buddy pairs nicely with the Relabel plugin.

**Update:** the functionality this plugin provides can be done in base Craft. Edit a User -> Preferences -> enable "Show field handles in edit forms" under the Development heading.
